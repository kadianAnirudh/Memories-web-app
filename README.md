<p>  • This is personally my favorite project, out of all 6 of my major projects. </p>

<p>  • This is a full stack MERN application where cards are created for every memory that you pass through the input form. </p>

<p>  • The data is stored in Mongo DB, a map function runs for the array of data, creating a memory card for each object stored. </p>

<p>  • This is a CRUD based application where you can edit and delete the memory cards according to your choice. </p>

<p>  • This project is completely screen responsive, with the form appearing at top of the screen for user's convenience. </p>
